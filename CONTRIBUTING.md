# Contributing

## Scope

Tools that compose agent steps, delegate work, or manage multi-agent workflows. Coding-agent clients and model-routing gateways are separate categories. Frameworks require application code; visual builders provide an authoring interface.

## Suggest an entry or correction

[Open an issue](https://github.com/AgentListIO/awesome-agent-orchestration/issues/new) or submit a pull request. Include the official project URL, the category, a short factual description, and a primary source supporting it.

- Prefer maintained projects with usable documentation. Mark maintenance-only projects explicitly.
- Link canonical upstream repositories; avoid affiliate links, mirrors, and duplicate entries.
- Keep descriptions neutral. Do not copy promotional claims, benchmark rankings, or security guarantees.
- Do not use stars as a quality score. Distinguish a hosted service from its SDK and self-hostable code.
- Add related awesome lists to `related`, not to the project entries.

## Edit and validate

`list.json` is the source of truth. Update it, then run:

```sh
bun run build
bun run check
```

Commit both `list.json` and the generated `README.md`. The check verifies record fields, duplicate URLs, and that the README matches the data; it does not verify live links or project capabilities. Change an entry’s `checked` date only after checking its upstream documentation.

Descriptions and list data are dedicated to the public domain under [CC0](LICENSE). Each linked project retains its own license. Entries are editorial records, not endorsements or paid placements.
